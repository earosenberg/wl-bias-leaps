* TODO Week 02/07-06/07
** DONE Let galsim choose postage stamp size (02-07-18)
** DONE Stop averaging over g1, g2 (02-07-18)
** DONE Convert to chi type manually
 w/ last eq before sec 2.2 of Mandelbaum Great3
** Get error on m
Use bootstrap nlog^2(n)
** Do weighted average over all SNR to find g hat, then find error on m
Fix a noise level sigma_N, use flux values such that SNR is 5-200
** DONE Make catalog, read from it
Gal ID, Flux/magnitude, size, sersic n, intrinsic ellipticity
** DONE Plotting stuff..
** DONE Keep rotated galaxies together when bootstrapping
** Use fits or ascii for saving instead of pickle
** Output catalog with measured ellipticity, size
** Use same seed each time for bootstrap
** Implement better bootstrap algorithm
